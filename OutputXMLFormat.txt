Description of the elements
solution: It's the root element of the XMl file
instance: It's the solution description of a given problem instance.
name: The name of the problem instance solved. The same as in the input XML.
heuristic: Description of the heuristic method used to solve this instance. One could add elements to this element to account for the specific tuning of the heuristic e.g. seed client.
objective_function: Description of the objective function used to compute the costs or aptitudes to solve this instance problem.
name: Identifier of this objective function
parameter_count: Number of parameters received from input needed to compute the objective function.
parameter_#: Parameter number # given to the objective function.
total_distance: Sum of distances of the different routes in this instance of the solution.
total_time: Sum of the time spent for the different routes in this instance of the solution.
total_aptitude: Result of running the objective function over this instance of the solution.
date: The date this file was generated.
execution_time: The time of execution taken by the algorithm to solve this problem.
pc_specification: important data refeent to the computer where the program is running.
os_name: The name of the operating system as received by Java
os_architecture: The architecture of the operating system as received by Java
processor_count: The number of porccesors available to the JVM
routes: This will contain all the routes of one solution.
route: Description of a single route of the solution. One could add elements to this element to give specific results e.g. time, distance, etc.
vehicle_capacity: The capacity of the vehicle assigned to this route.
total_demand: The sum of the demand of the clients assgined to this route
client_count: Number of clients in this route.
client_#: #th client in the route.

Opcion cliente:
<client>
	<position>
	<number>
</client>
