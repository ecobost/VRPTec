Description of elements
instance: It's an specific instance of the problem.
type: It's the type of the problem instance e.g. VRPTW.
name: It's the name of the instance.
vehicles: A description of the different types of vehicles that will be used to solve the problem.
set: A set of vehicles with common features. By now, only one set of vehicles (all with the same capacity) is accepted.
vehicle_count: Number of vehicles in this set.
capacity: The capacity of the vehicles in this set.
client: A single client/customer.
number: The number of the client. The depot is the client 0
x: x coordinate
y: y coordinate
demand: The demand of the client. How much product it wants.
service_time: The service time of a client. How much it takes to complete the delivery once it has beginning.
time_window: The time window in which a client will accept a delivery
start: Start of the time window. Inclusive
end: End of the time window. Inclusive
flexible: This is a [Y|N] element stating if this particular time windows is flexible, it is the vehicle can arrive after the end of the tw and still make the delivery.
distances: Distances to other clients. If a client is not stated the distance is assumed to be infinite.
times: Times to other clients. If a client is not stated the time is assumed to be infinite.
